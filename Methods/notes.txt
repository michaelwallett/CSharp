Instance Constructors
---------------------

Constructors are called .ctor in a method definition table.
The C# compiler will generate code in the constructor for fields that are initialised inline.
The CLR always allows the creation of a value type.
	The C# compiler does not emit a default constructor for value types.
	You cannot define your own default constructor.
You must initialise all fields in value type constructor.
