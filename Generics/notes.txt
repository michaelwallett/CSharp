Generics
--------

Uppercase T stands for type.
When defining a generic type or method, any variables it specifies for types (such as T) are called type parameters.
When using a generic type or method, the specified data types are called type arguments.

Generics provide the following benefits:
	Source code protection.
		With C++ templates or Java generics, the algorithm's source code must be available to the developer.
	Type safety.
	Cleaner code (fewer casts).
	Improved performace.
		When populating an ArrayList with a value type, the CLR has to box the value type, causing memory allocations on the heap, which in turn causes more frequent garbage collections.
		The CLR dosen't have to check type safety.
