Primitive Types
---------------

Any type the compiler directly supports.
The compiler is able to cast primitive types implicity and explicitly.
Implicit casts are "safe" becuase they do not result in data loss.
Primitive types can be written as literals. A literal is an instace of the type itself.

Overflow Checking
-----------------

C# has overflow checking off by default.
